Create a Python application for a simple Student Management System. The application should include the following functionalities:
1.	Class Definition: Define a Student class that:
o	Has instance variables name and age.
o	Has a class variable college_name that is shared among all instances.
2.	Methods: Implement the following methods within the Student class:
o	Instance Methods:
	get_details(): Returns the details of the student (name, age, and college name).
o	Class Methods:
	change_college(new_college): Allows changing the college_name for all instances of Student.
o	Static Methods:
	is_adult(age): Takes an age as input and returns True if the age is 18 or above, otherwise returns False.
3.	Inner Class: Create an inner class called Address that has attributes city and state. It should also have a method get_address() to return the address details.
4.	Data Transfer Between Classes: Define another class called Course. This class should:
o	Accept a Student object during initialization and store its details.
o	Have a method get_student_info() that returns the details of the student in that course.
