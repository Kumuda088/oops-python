Create a Python application for a simple Hotel Management System. This application should have the following features:
1.	Class Definition: Define a Hotel class that:
o	Has instance variables name, location, and rating.
o	Has a class variable hotel_chain that is the same across all instances.
2.	Methods: Implement the following methods within the Hotel class:
o	Instance Methods:
	get_hotel_info(): Returns information about the hotel including its name, location, rating, and hotel chain.
o	Class Methods:
	change_hotel_chain(new_chain): Allows changing the hotel_chain for all instances of Hotel.
o	Static Methods:
	is_high_rated(rating): Takes a rating as input and returns True if the rating is 4 or above, otherwise returns False.
3.	Inner Class: Create an inner class called Room that has attributes room_number, room_type, and price. It should have a method get_room_details() to return the room details.
4.	Data Transfer Between Classes: Define another class called Reservation. The Reservation class should:
o	Accept a Hotel object and a Room object during initialization.
o	Have a method get_reservation_info() that returns information about the hotel and the reserved room.
