Demonstrate a Python program that defines a class Animal with a constructor that takes name 
and age as parameters, and a method display_info to print the name and age of the animal. 
Create an object of the class and call the method to display the animal's details.

class Animal:
    def __init__(self,name,age):
        self.name=name
        self.age=age
    def display_info(self):
        print(self.name)
        print(self.age)
my_animal=Animal("Buddy",5)
my_animal.display_info()
