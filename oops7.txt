INHERITANCE:- 

Real-World Example in Code:
class Family:
    def __init__(self, surname):
        self.surname = surname

class Child(Family):
    def __init__(self, surname, name):
        super().__init__(surname)
        self.name = name

child = Child("Gowda", "Ajay")
print(f"{child.name} {child.surname}")  # Inherits surname from Family





Programming Example in Code:
class User:
    def __init__(self, username):
        self.username = username

    def login(self):
        print(f"{self.username} logged in")

class Admin(User):
    def delete_user(self, user):
        print(f"Admin {self.username} deleted user {user}")

admin = Admin("karnataka_admin")
admin.login()  # Inherited from User
admin.delete_user("user_102")  # Admin-specific method
